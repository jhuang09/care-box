            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to this website! It is very much a work-in-progress, but the goal of this website is to become more familiar with web programming. As of this moment, it is written entirely in HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>This website is also an assignment for Tufts's COMP20 (Web Programming) course, where each student creates a website that offers some services. For this website, it offers a subscription-like care package for those who need them. I feel like this idea already exists somewhere or is in the making, but after a rough year, I think receiving care packages can be an exciting part of life! After all, who doesn't like getting things in the mail ;).</p>
